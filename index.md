## CPSC 120

Lab 04: I enjoyed this lab since we created a guessing game. I also learned how “if statements” work, not only that I also learned how they run and work. I also played this game with a few friends.



Lab 06: I did part two, which was the blackjack game, even though it was a struggle to complete. I enjoyed the challenge. I was also able to play this game.




Lab 07: Part two, I enjoyed this lab since we created a program we can actually use in real life scenarios/ I also found this lab interesting since we are able to determine if there is actually parking with time and street.
